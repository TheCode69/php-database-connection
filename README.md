Create a Connection: The mysqli constructor is used to create a connection to the MySQL database. It takes four parameters: hostname, username, password, and database name.

Check the Connection: The if ($conn->connect_error) statement checks if the connection to the database was successful. If there is an error, the script dies and displays an error message.

Perform Database Operations: You can perform database operations (such as querying, updating, or inserting data) within the block where it says "You can perform database operations here."

Close the Connection: Finally, the $conn->close(); line is used to close the database connection when you are done with it. It's a good practice to close the connection after you've finished your database operations.

Make sure to handle your database credentials securely, for example, by storing them in a separate configuration file that is not accessible from the web. Also, consider using prepared statements or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection attacks when interacting with the database.
